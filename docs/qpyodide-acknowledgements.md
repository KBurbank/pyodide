We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to several individuals and teams who played a pivotal role in bringing [`quarto-pyodide`](https://github.com/coatless-quarto/pyodide) to life as an extension for Quarto. Without their dedication and contributions, this project would not have been possible.

## Quarto Team Assistance

We would like to acknowledge the Quarto team for their assistance.

## Inspirations

Our project built upon the initial proof of concept for a standalone Quarto HTML document, made possible by the work of the [coatless-r-n-d/pyodide-quarto-demo](https://github.com/coatless-r-n-d/pyodide-quarto-demo) repository.

We would also like to thank [George Stagg](https://github.com/georgestagg) and his work on [webR](https://webr.r-wasm.org/), which greatly contributed to moving forward with the [`quarto-webr`](https://github.com/coatless/quarto-webr) extension that allowed interactive R code inside of Quarto.

# Fin

Once again, thank you to everyone who contributed, collaborated, and provided support throughout this project. Your dedication and expertise have made this achievement possible.
