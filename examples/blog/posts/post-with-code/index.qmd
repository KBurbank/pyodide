This is a post with interactive code on a [Quarto Blog](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html) through the [`quarto-pyodide`](https://github.com/coatless-quarto/pyodide) extension. The configuration setup for the `quarto-pyodide` extension is taken care of in the `_quarto.yml` file to avoid needing to re-specify options multiple times.

```{pyodide-python}
print("Hello {quarto-pyodide} blog world!")
```
